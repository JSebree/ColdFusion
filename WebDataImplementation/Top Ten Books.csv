Whether you find this prospect wonderful or terrifying, you will want to read this extremely thought-provoking book.”—Brian Eno, musician and composer""Kevin Kelly has been predicting our technological future with uncanny prescience for years.

Bradbury's vividly painted society holds up the appearance of happiness as the highest goal--a place where trivial information is good, and knowledge and ideas are bad. Fire Captain Beatty explains it this way, ""Give the people contests they win by remembering the words to more popular songs.... Don't give them slippery stuff like philosophy or sociology to tie things up with. That way lies melancholy.""Guy Montag is a book-burning fireman undergoing a crisis of faith. His wife spends all day with her television ""family,"" imploring Montag to work harder so that they can afford a fourth TV wall. Their dull, empty life sharply contrasts with that of his next-door neighbor Clarisse, a young girl thrilled by the ideas in books, and more interested in what she can see in the world around her than in the mindless chatter of the tube. When Clarisse disappears mysteriously, Montag is moved to make some changes, and starts hiding books in his home. Eventually, his wife turns him in, and he must answer the call to burn his secret cache of books. After fleeing to avoid arrest, Montag winds up joining an outlaw band of scholars who keep the contents of books in their heads, waiting for the time society will once again need the wisdom of literature.Bradbury--the author of more than 500 short stories, novels, plays, and poems, including The Martian Chronicles and The Illustrated Man--is the winner of many awards, including the Grand Master Award from the Science Fiction Writers of America. Readers ages 13 to 93 will be swept up in the harrowing suspense of Fahrenheit 451, and no doubt will join the hordes of Bradbury fans worldwide. --Neil Roseman --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",4.4,English,Reissued,NA1476746583,All the Light We Cannot See,Anthony Doerr,Scribner,6-May-14,fiction,historical fiction,531,16.84,15.3,"Marie-Laure lives with her father in Paris near the Museum of Natural History, where he works as the master of its thousands of locks.
